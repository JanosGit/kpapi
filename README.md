# kpapi
A C++ class representing a Kemper Profiling Amp connected via MIDI as a single cpp object. Depending on my simpleMIDI (https://github.com/JanosGit/simpleMIDI) implementation and therefore compatible with all platforms simpleMIDI supports

Still under development. Will add some more description when there is some more functionality ;)
