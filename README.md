# kpapi
A C++ class representing a Kemper Profiling Amp connected via MIDI as a single cpp object. Depending on my simpleMIDI (https://github.com/JanosGit/simpleMIDI) implementation and therefore compatible with all platforms simpleMIDI supports

This thing is still under development and shouldn't be considered as stable, so I will add some more description when there is some more functionality ;)

If you want to clone it anyway, you should use 
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/JanosGit/kpapi.git
```
to also include the simpleMIDI library which is a submodule to this repo.
